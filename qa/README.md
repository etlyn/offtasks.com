# Offtasks Web acceptance suites

This product owns and maintains [manifest.json](manifest.json), the read-only
acceptance asset imported by the standalone E2E website. It currently contains
11 suites and 59 cases migrated from etlyn-e2e without adding product behavior.

When product behavior changes, update this manifest in the same pull request.
Keep app, suite, and case IDs stable; change an ID only for a new identity.
Use the common [Etlyn manifest schema](https://e2e.etlyn.com/schema/manifest.schema.json).
Do not store credentials, real customer data or executable scripts in manifests.

An E2E admin registers app ID `offtasks-web`, platform `web`, repository
`etlyn/offtasks.com`, branch `main`, path `qa/manifest.json`, then chooses
**Import latest**. The importer pins the branch to a commit and preserves older
runs. A local uncommitted change is not available to GitHub imports.

The original Gherkin files remain under `legacy/offtasks/web/features` for historical
reference; the JSON manifest is authoritative for online testing. The optional
legacy runner can use `E2E_ROOT` set to this repository's `qa/legacy` directory.
Online run results live in E2E, never in this source repo.
